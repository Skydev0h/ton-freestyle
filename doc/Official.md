## [Primary initial contest post](https://t.me/contest/139)

The 2nd stage of the blockchain contest starts today. 

**Dates:** 7 Dec - 22 Dec 2019.

**Prizes:** $100,000 will be distributed among the winners (+additional $100,000 will be awarded subject to certain conditions). 

**Who can take part:** 41 winners of the [1st stage](https://contest.com/blockchain).

**Goal:** build one or two TON-based smart-contracts (decentralized services) that can become popular with consumers.

**Criteria to identify the winners:** 1) The validity and efficiency of your code 2) The potential demand for your service from a consumer standpoint. 

**Description:** in Stage 1, you have proved that you know how to build smart-contracts on TON. This time you may choose any idea you like for your smart-contract - and implement it. You will retain the ownership over the decentralized projects resulting from this contest. You are also encouraged to launch your apps on TON mainnet once its live. 

Your project should be decentralized and built with a TON-based smart-contract, but can also include off-chain elements if required. Each participant may submit a maximum of two projects.

Participants may request **5000** Test Grams from [@test_ton_bot](http://t.me/test_ton_bot) to test and develop their apps.

Good luck!

## [Explanation regarding external software](https://t.me/contest/140)

We received questions regarding the use of external software in the [second stage](https://t.me/contest/139) of the **Blockchain Competition**. 

While you may submit such projects, note that code ported from Solidity apps is likely to be less efficient. 

During evaluation, we are likely to prioritize apps built with Fift/FunC toolchain over apps built with third-party toolchains (e.g. Solidity compilers for TVM), but you are welcome to use any tools you like. If you are using third-party solutions, make sure you include detailed build instructions.

## [Final message about submission deadline](https://t.me/contest/143)

You can now submit entries for the [second stage](https://t.me/contest/139) of the **TON Blockchain Contest** to [@jobs_bot](http://t.me/jobs_bot).

The bot will expect:
1. A link to a GitHub repository with the source code of your project.
2. The address of your smart contract in TON testnet2.

Please make sure that your GitHub repository includes a ReadMe file with a description of your project and how users will interact with it. Don't forget to explain how your code should be used to deploy and use your smart contract.

The deadline for submissions is **Dec 22, 23:50 Dubai Time**.

## [Extra message about multiple projects](https://t.me/contest/144)

1. If you created multiple projects for the **Blockchain Contest**, please **resubmit** them to [@jobs_bot](http://t.me/jobs_bot) – the bot will now offer to send it a second link/address after you submit the first.

2. Submissions for the **Data Clustering Contest** can now be tested on the second evaluation data set. (raw, en, ru)
