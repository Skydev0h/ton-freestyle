# TON freestyle contest entry

[*(Blockchain competition number 2 - Official requirements and documentation)*](doc/Official.md)

This package contains a participation entry for second blockchain contest of TON for creating own freestyle smart contracts. 

Official description of objectives, rules and requirements is done on [the referenced page](doc/Official.md). 

As per project ideas themselves, **two** smart contract projects were chosen to be implemented:

* [**Conditional transfer smart contract**](doc/Project1.md)
* [**Data storage proxy smart contract**](doc/Project2.md)

More details about those ideas should be read on their respective pages linked above.

**It should be noted that in order to run tests, a patch should be applied**, that adds fift commands `(gas)runvmctxact` that allows **inspecting resulting action register (c5)** after the contract execution to run tests more thoroughly. It may be possible to disable that functionality by swapping comments on first lines, but that is not recommended.

Link to this patch on the GitHub repository: *To be defined*.

Quick-start instructions about using those contracts can be found [here](doc/Quick.md).

Technical details about implementations are on their corresponding pages.

There were some other ideas, that were trashed for one or another reason, due to low subjective usefulness, high complexity or unprepared infrastructure, you can get acquainted with them [here](doc/Unchosen.md), if interested.

Good luck to all participants and Happy New Year!
