# TON freestyle contest entry

[*(Blockchain competition number 2 - Official requirements and documentation)*](doc/Official.md)

This package contains a participation entry for second blockchain contest of TON for creating own freestyle smart contracts. 

Official description of objectives, rules and requirements is done on [the referenced page](doc/Official.md). 

As per project ideas themselves, **two** smart contract projects were chosen to be implemented:

* [**Conditional transfer smart contract**](doc/Project1.md)
* [**Data storage proxy smart contract**](doc/Project2.md)

More details about those ideas should be read on their respective pages linked above.

Quick-start instructions about using those contracts can be found [here](doc/Quick.md).

Technical details about implementations are on their corresponding pages.

There were some other ideas, that were trashed for one or another reason, due to low subjective usefulness, high complexity or unprepared infrastructure, you can get acquainted with them [here](doc/Unchosen.md), if interested.

Good luck to all participants and Happy New Year!
